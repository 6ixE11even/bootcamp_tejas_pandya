# Project Title
**Stage 1:** Problem Framing & Scoping

## Problem Statement
LocalChain Grocery is a local chain of grocery stores. Daily thousands of products are bought from these stores. Efficiently managing inventory of over 1000+ SKUs is cumbersome. Some items are sold very quickly while others just pile up and eventually become wastage.

Manually managing inventory on Excel sheets is error prone and slow. An automated and data-driven approach is required to solve the inventory issues effectively.

## Stakeholders and Users
- **Who decides?** Operations Director at LocalChain
- **Who uses the output?** Operations Managers at each LocalChain outlet
- **Timings** Weekly restocking of inventory

## Useful Answers and Decision
- **Type:** Predictive - as we need to forecast demand of all SKUs
- **Deliverable:** Python generated report or spreadsheet recommending next week's SKUs which needs to be reorder and in what quantity
